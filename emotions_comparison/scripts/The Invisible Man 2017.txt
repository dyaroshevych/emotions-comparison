Griffin! Griffin! Hello? Hey. It's okay, it's me. Holy shit! The experiment. You tried the experiment on yourself? What the hell would make you do that? I have to finish. Easy, easy. Hey, Professor. Wait, where did you get this? What? This bracelet? What are you talking about? This belonged to my son. How do you have it? I don't know what you're talking about. Hey, you're hurting me. I don't know, I got it from a friend. Who? I don't remember. Who's your friend? Did it ever occur to you that there might be more than one of these in the world? I'm sorry. Hello. Miss Shipley, I suppose. You can call me Faith. I can't believe how beautiful it is in here. Are you an actor? No, why? Your lab is in a theater. Oh, right. When the university eliminated it's theater program, I couldn't stand the thought of it being abandoned. Plus, it's quiet here. It allows me to work undisturbed. I'm just gonna put this out there, I know that I was assigned to you, that you don't know me, you're probably concerned about my motives, I get that. But I would like to see if we could put that behind us and just be two scientists who need to work together. It's just that I heard you didn't want me here. Oh it's not that. Well it's exactly that. But it's not about you personally, because I don't know you personally. I'm not exactly sure that I want to know you. You might be quite charming, but I do know that I've always worked best alone. Tristan mentioned that. Tristan? I take it the two of you are familiar? You could say that. It's complicated, but that's not why he sent me. I believe I will be an asset to you. Is this the part where you recite your resume to me? I could. That won't be necessary. I already looked you up. Faith Anne Shipley, Theoretical Physicist, PhD from Eldrich University, fellow at Oxford with the focus on absorption. Not married, although I haven't determined why, no children, how am I doing? Concise, but accurate. Now you forgot to mention that my father is dead, my mother is remarried to someone whom I do not approve of that lives in Reading, I love art, Impressionism to be exact, which is a bit strange for a scientist, and I would love to win the Nobel Peace Prize, despite the fact that I think awards are pretentious. Anything else? No, I wouldn't want to overwhelm you on our first day. Well nice to meet you, Faith. Likewise. So, what are you working on? What do you know about optical density? Well the optical density of a substance is the logarithmic ratio of transmitted light to the intensity of the instant light passing through a substance. Exactly. I have discovered a general principal on pigmentations and retraction, a geometrical expression involving four dimensions. A method that will make it possible without changing any property of matter except color in some instances to lower the refractive index of a substance to that of liquid or air. Anything transparent becomes practically invisible if put into any media of the same refractive index. For instance, if I put this piece of glass into the water, it vanishes almost completely from sight. Because light passing from water to glass is only slightly affected in any way. It's almost as invisible as a jet of gas in air for the same reason. If I was to smash this piece of glass and beat it into a powder, it would become more visible while it's in the air. The refraction of the powder multiplies the surfaces of light in the glass, but if you put the bits of glass back in the water, it vanishes again. Invisibility. Yes. I've devised a method, a formula if you will, that can render almost anything invisible. Let me show you. Stay still. Did you just? What do you think? About what? Your hair. It's gone, take it. It's invisible, don't take my word for it, really examine it. What an incredible. Does this process work on everything? Nearly. It works on cotton fiber, wood fiber, bone, imagine that, bone. Flesh, hair, nails, and nerves, the entire fabric of man. And you did this by yourself? Yes, I am on the verge of the greatest scientific event in the history of man. Oh my God, unbelievable. Okay, and have you told anyone? No. What are you doing? I'm taking notes. No, no, no notes. - Hey, why not? - I need the sample. No, okay well that's mine. If we are to work together, this must remain amongst ourselves. Yeah, if. Now I know that you don't know me, but I'm not a huge fan of deception. Where you at? No, no. Griffin? There you are. Anything interesting? Just noticing that we don't really know who anyone really is, do we? When they walk by, the faceless strangers. They're all a mystery, watch. I sometimes wonder if there's a way that we can really see each other beyond the facades that we all have. I see you. Do you? Why are you here, Faith? I'm sure it had nothing to do with sharing a sandwich. It's tuna fish, by the way, would you like some? I thought you'd never ask. So I would like to start over. I take it he didn't believe you. No. I'm glad he didn't. Are you mad at me? I should be. I am sorry. At the very least you could have brought something for us to drink to make it a proper apology, or cookies, I like cookies. Are you being nice to me? When you came in yesterday I was like a schoolboy who wanted to share his work with someone. I don't think working alone has been good for me. I must, however, make a request. That the nature of this work opens us up to a great deal of possible ridicule, it's not my intention to be deceptive in any way. My ultimate goal is to have my work published, after all. But I would just ask that you use your discretion. Keep our work with as little attention on it as possible until it's complete. That sounds reasonable. Do we have an understanding? Yes. Let's get to work then. Cordrazine. Yes, I believe it will help balance out the effects of the monocaine. Then let's try it. No names this time. Of course. It's okay Dixie. Morning. So I hope you don't mind, I stayed the night. But you see, I was looking over your notes and I think I found out what caused the reaction. It may be the amount of monocaine hydrochloride we used. Now I did some research, and depending on the quantity it can cause death. Monocaine, monocaine. You were talking in your sleep. Was I? What was I saying? Oh, you were talking about someone named Kathryn. Thank you. She's my ex-wife. She haunts me from time to time. Did she die? No, she just haunts me. She's very much alive. Do you miss her. I have regrets, mostly. I think I miss the idea of her, the idea of a significant other. Relationships are difficult. Experience or opinion? Education. Advanced degree. PhD. I'm intrigued. Unlucky in love? You could say that. You should start a club. I could be a founding member. Although, I must confess on my part I wasn't a very good husband. Why is that? Your work. I threw myself into it after... Would you believe she felt I committed too much time to it? How could she have gotten that idea? You? Cheating, I have a knack for selecting men who aren't loyal. I have many faults, but cheating is not one of them. So you're a one woman man? I am. Well, there must be hope for you then. And is there hope for you? Oh with Tristan? I'll never get used to calling him that. I'm not sure. I continue to have trouble keeping his interest. You're still together? Yeah, well no. You know what, it's complicated. But I'm trying to be optimistic. I'm not. I'm quite happy with my mini refrigerator, my frozen dinners, and my work. Keeps life simple, free from heartache. Besides, it's difficult to imagine myself with someone now. I'm a bit of an acquired taste, as I'm sure you can attest to. Odd, that's the word I would use. In a good way, like an imported wine. Let's hope someone can appreciate my vintage. I consider myself to be a bit of a disaster. Well, then here's to beautiful disasters. Let me see. Are you okay? Yeah. Who are you looking at? What time is it? What? The time. Oh, it's 12:47. Who is that? It's a former student of mine. Do you wanna go talk to him? No. Faith, wait up. You've been avoiding me. No, I've just been busy. Hey I wanna see you. How about lunch? Maybe something better than lunch. Tempting, but I have a lot of work to do. Faith. Okay, what about Saturday? We could do breakfast, there's that nice place Romano's out by the bay. How are things going with Griffin? Good. That was vague. Well there's nothing new to report. And what about the invisibility? You've got to be kidding me. Come on, I'm appealing to your charitable nature. Be patient, you just, you have to let this play out. Hey. I have a lot invested in this. I know, I will keep you updated. Well, how do I look? You look quite lovely tonight. What's the occasion? I thought we could celebrate. Celebrate? I know it's been a few weeks, but the experiment appears to be a success. Dixie is visible again, so I brought you something. A gift. It's cookies, men like cookies, or so I've been told. Thank you. But I'm not sure that we should be celebrating just yet. Why not? We haven't tested this on a human. A human? Of course, that's the ultimate goal, isn't it? Think of what could be accomplished if a man could become invisible. What's that? Exact revenge. Grim, try again. Espionage? Illegal. Worst case, you could always work for the paparazzi. Show up with the most scandalous pictures of celebrities in compromising positions and the like. Yeah, I could see you now in prison orange. Do you find me attractive? I never thought about it. Really, 'cause sometimes the way you look at me makes me think that you do. You are. I mean, I do. Okay, I'm making you uncomfortable, I'm sorry. That was not my intention. I just thought it would be nice to go out. It would. - I do go out, it would be nice. - Okay. Allow me to get changed. - Okay. - Okay. Give me a moment. Okay, we have your lunch. It's quinoa, you like quinoa? - No. - You don't? There's kale in there as well. Kale's good for you, you like kale? You're not in California, turn around. I can't believe you're going to middle school. You know what that means? What? Girls, dating, this is where it starts. - Dad. - It where I met your mother. No you didn't. It's true, right honey? We met in college. But I was watching her from middle school. I'm warning you, true love awaits. You look like twins. You think so? I'm the better looking twin. Go get your jacket. But it's not cold. Go. Are you gonna be okay? Yes. Well that makes one of us. He's growing up so fast. Take it easy on the ladies. I'll try. And don't drink and drive. Like you? We'll get that license back. No you won't. Don't do drugs, at least not all the drugs. Stop. Alright, let's go. I know what you did. I know what you did. What are you talking about? What is this, some kind of trophy? This belonged to my son, I'm positive now. You're crazy. I'm not. You don't know anything. I'll tell the police. Tell them what? About this. I've never seen that before. What is it? Let me see him, is my son dead? Is my son dead? Drinking without me? How did your meeting go? Good. Did I interrupt something? An anniversary of sorts. Who is he, the boy? The one in the picture? Riley, my son. I didn't know you had any children. I don't, he's dead. Hey, do you wanna talk about it? I would prefer not to, except to say that today is the anniversary of his death which is always difficult. You have news? Yes. I was able to secure our financing. That's good. You know you can always talk to me if you need to. A challenge I am attempting to overcome. I bought some of your favorite things today, I thought it would make your work here more pleasant. Sorry. - I can't. - It's okay. You know what, I shouldn't have done that. It's okay. No, no it's not. Tristan's planning on proposing. I'm supposed to be there right now. Congratulations are in order, I'm happy for you. Are you? - Griffin, are you? - Of course. Okay, I'm sorry, I should go. Stupid. You are so stupid. Stupid. You are so stupid! Well this is a first. You've never stood me up before. I know, I got tied up at work. Work? Tonight of all nights. Yes. Look I've been thinking about it, about us, and I feel like I'm being pressured. Pressured? - I haven't even asked you yet. - I know. Hey look, you've been drinking tonight. Okay, we shouldn't have this discussion right now. There's never a good time with you anymore. Okay, well we've been making significant progress lately... You think I care about that? Okay, shh. You are raising your voice. I'll yell if I want to! - Who cares?! - Since when have you become so desperate? It's not becoming. What happened? We used to be able to talk. Talk to me. You know what, I just need to think. About what? Look I care a great deal about you. But you're not in love? No. - Don't. - Stop it. Get off of me. This is over. Griffin? Griffin? Hello? Griffin? Hey. It's okay, it's me. Griffin, holy shit. The experiment. You tried the experiment on yourself? What the hell would make you do that? I have to tell you... Easy, easy. I'm coming, I'm coming, hold on. Easy, easy. Come on, up. Up, come on. - Sit down, sit down. - I'm okay. No you're not, just sit down. Easy, just relax, okay? Hey, talk to me, what happened? I should ask you the same question. Don't worry about me. Tell me what I can do to help you. What happened? I told him no, okay? Okay, how are you feeling? Do you feel any pain? Getting better. Stomach's burning up. Hey, just take slow deep breaths, okay? Why why why would you do this? Jealousy I imagine. Over me? Is every man I know insane? Don't lump me in with him. Why not? You could have killed yourself. What's this? It's a sedative. Easy, easy. How am I doing? Better, I think. Your heart's slowing down. You know, he's not as bad as you think he is. Tristan, he meant well. Why did you say no? Well you know women, we're complex. That you are. So are men, for the record. Come on. Easy, sorry. Hey, Faith. Who is it? Don't touch me, don't touch me. It's okay, just calm down. It worked, I'm invisible. Griffin, you almost gave me a heart attack. Where are you? Right here in front of you. Reach out. Oh. Oh my God. This is incredible. It is, isn't it? What happened? I bumped my knee against the desk. I'm trying to get used to not having visual cues myself when I walk. Wait, wait, wait stop. I don't know where you are. That's the point isn't it? Yes, but I would prefer knowing. Wait, are you naked? Yes. Okay, ooh. There's something completely perverse about that. I feel like I'm in a room with a flasher or something. Could you put some clothes on, please? Okay, for some reason I thought clothing would help, but you are still quite disturbing. I've had some ideas of what I can do now that I'm invisible, but I'd like to know what your thoughts are on the matter. Okay, well you certainly can't go out looking like this. People won't know what to make of you. I think it's more a matter of how I go out. If you go out like this, people will think you're either recovering from god knows what or that you're some sort of criminal. I think you're forgetting the temptation to go out not wearing this. Which I imagine is strong. Understated, to say the least. It's taken everything in me to not leave. The only thing, I think, that has prohibited me from doing so is the fact that I would need to be completely naked. I've not embraced my inner nudist as of yet. The weather would make it difficult as well, it's freezing out there. No, the only option, at least for now, is to stay and complete our studies. Discover the solution to reverse the process. Thank God. What? Nothing, I just thought you were gonna say you wanted to sneak into a women's locker room or something. I've already scheduled myself to do that tomorrow at noon. I'm a scientist, I'm still a man. Okay, I still haven't absorbed the idea that you're invisible yet. How are you managing? Better, I'm not bumping into things as much. I think we should start cataloging the effects of the process. Okay. First, I find that my lucidity is better than it's been before. I'm not sure if that has to do with the idea that I can no longer be superficially judged or that I'm now devoid of self-criticism, but I find myself to be freer than I've ever felt before. Okay, why do you think that is? I think that psychologically it's purified me. Erasing the defects that I perceived myself to have. Oh is that an actual effect, or just a perception on your part? I'm not sure. Sit down. What? Just because you feel normal doesn't mean that you are. So I'm going to have a full workup done on you. I have a concern to raise. Okay, what's that? I don't want to be the cause of a rift between you and Tristan. How so? I'm concerned that in my present state I will become dependent upon you. And you're afraid of coming in between us? Perhaps. Is it that, or is it your desire to repress the feelings you started to have for me? A bit of both. Tristan and I are over. He just needs to accept that. And I am here for you, for as long as you need me. Just look normal, act normal, you'll see. No one notices a thing. It's hard to act normal when you're steering me like this. Right turn. Okay, what exactly are we doing. Seeing how I can maneuver in public. When there's a distraction, to get to me is more difficult. You are the distraction. Where are we going? To Tristan Hagan's office. Okay wait, stop. I do not want to see him. You're not going to see him. Then what are we doing. I need access to Tristan's office. There's a piece of information I need. His computer more precisely. Are we gonna break in? Nothing so insidious. We're gonna walk through the front door. Stop. - We're gonna get caught. - He's not here. Oh this is a surprise. - Shit. - Oh sorry, deep breath. Turn around. You haven't returned my phone calls. Well that's because I didn't want to talk to you. What does one say after they've been beaten? Well as I recall you managed quite well for yourself. My jaw was sore for a week. Was that your attempt at an apology? Look, if you've come to fight, now go. Wait, just stop. I did want to talk to you. Despite everything that's happened, I don't want to lose our friendship. How very gracious of you. Is that what we've become now, friends? Look in this case I think it's better than the alternative. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. This is about Griffin, isn't it? You started to have feelings for him. Unbelievable, he is an odd one. Okay, I don't share that opinion. Well it's not an opinion, it's a fact. What could you possibly find attractive about him? That's not a discussion I'm going to have with you. Why are you here? It just occurred to me that you've come to see me, you're standing outside of my office, so what do you want? And please don't tell me it's because you wanted to save our friendship. It's about your job, isn't it? Is that how low you think of me? If that's your concern, then you can rest assured I have no intention of firing you. Alright, contrary to popular belief, I'm not the neanderthal you believe me to be. Oh, thank you. I cannot believe you put me through that. Believe me, that was not my intention. That was as difficult for me as it was for you. I hardly believe that. Do you think it's easy to see how much he cares for you? Am I detecting jealousy? There may be a valid argument made for that. Odd, what did he mean by that? You are odd. Am I? One might argue that walking around naked in the park during the day is considered odd. Touche. So did you find what you needed? I believe so. What exactly were you looking for? Information about the student who killed my son. Wait a student? Yes. Are you certain? No, but I intend to find out. Okay, Griffin, I don't know if that's... Griffin? Griffin? Griffin? You love the jack, which is worth more than the tires. What do you guys think? It's clean. Hey, you guys want a beer? Yeah. Hey man, sorry about your brother. Yeah, it's been tough. Well man, I'm an optimist. I'm sure he'll show up eventually. Yeah. You live in a barn? - Close the door. - I did. I thought I did. Hey, brought you your favorite. Tuna fish. Are you hungry? I got the results of my tests today. And? I found out I have a progressive neurological disorder along the line of Huntington's Disease. Okay, what does that mean? It means it will affect my motor skills, cause memory loss, dementia, and it will eventually destroy my mind. I was asked to come in for further diagnoses, but my present condition will not allow me to do that. No. It's spreading at a rate that's abnormal. Okay, would reversing the process stop it? I don't know. We have to try. Use the time that we have left to reverse it and change what's happening to you. You need to go. What? You need to leave. I'm doing this for you, and for me. It won't be long before I lose my lucidity and I do not want you to be a part of that. No, I'm not leaving. I only have a few weeks, I need to work. No. Look I'm in love with you. Look I know the circumstances couldn't be worse, but I'm not leaving the man that I love. That you love? Yes. You do realize that from now on nothing will ever be the same? Look. I need you to promise me something. It may be difficult to do so under the present circumstances. Promise me that you will fight. Griffin? I'm here. What are you doing? Thinking. I want to document my findings for the purposes of publishing them before I'm left with no time. It's my hope that you will see that the work is continued even after I'm... Please don't, don't say it. How are you feeling? I feel fine. However, I must admit that from time to time I feel a burning in my head. Like 1,000 little pins that are firing off one at a time. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but I can't stop it for hours once it begins. It makes it difficult to concentrate. But it doesn't change anything. Invisibility is quite beautiful. What's it like? You can't imagine it. It frees you from yourself. There is nothing but your thoughts. In a way, it's like being dead. The problems that you have are not there because you are not there. Does that make sense? Yeah. I'm a ghost of myself. I look for me sometimes and imagine that I can see me for who I can be, not who I am. It makes me appreciate what I see more. I never believed in gods, until I was invisible. Wait, why is that? I think science, by it's nature, wants to define things in a very finite way because of this we see everything as ordinary and common. Things that are in fact miracles. Miracles? You're one of them. I can see you in a way I've never seen anything before. Without distraction, without the concern for how you view me. Your true self. Are you becoming a romantic now? Perhaps. Griffin? Hey Griffin? Hey, what are you doing? Nothing. Okay, why didn't you answer me? Did you see anyone when you came in? No. I thought. They're antibodies that may help prevent the beta ambroid, which is the cause of your deterioration from clumping in your brain. I've been giving a lot of thought to what might have happened to you, and it is my belief that the process also somehow affected your ability to fight off disease. And if I'm right, we need to help your body's natural ability to fight off infection, which is what these are for. Thank you. What is it? I took your findings to Tristan. What did he say? He said he would review everything this week. And? And he wants to see you. Look, he's not just going to take my word that you're invisible. But I will talk to him ahead of time, let him know what to expect. Did you tell him about... Us? Yes, I told him everything. Including my condition? Yes. Was that a cause for him to celebrate? No. No he did not rejoice at the possibility of your death. He's still harboring feelings for you. Go on. What do you want me to say? He's not happy about it. What should I say about this? Nothing. Focus on the work. Leave us out of it. Fuck me. What the hell? I haven't forgotten you. What you did to him. You took the most precious thing from me. You killed my son. My beautiful son. Is this what he looked like right before you killed him? Laying there helpless? Having to say time to die. This is for Riley. Hey, you never answered my call. I was avoiding you. Why? I'm not ready. For what? For this meeting, can we reschedule? No, no, he's on his way. He's gonna be here in just a minute. I don't understand. Okay, look, look. We talked about this already. I've made a mess of things. I need to clean up. So stupid. I'm okay. You're not. It's the medication I'm taking, a side effect. Okay, we can't wait any longer. We have to get you to the hospital. I don't want to go. Look, you're not thinking straight. The medication helps, but it's not enough. You're right. I'll finish this meeting and then we will go. You have to help me, I need to get ready. Look you don't have to do this alone. I'm never alone. I have my work. I lose myself in it. You have to make sure he doesn't take this away from me. Promise me. Okay, I will do the best I can. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, come on. It's okay, let's get you ready, okay? Will you go back to him? I want you to be happy. To have someone who is normal. I don't imagine I fit the bill anymore. Who says that I want normal? Come on, you have created something that no one else has ever done. Being different is what makes me love you. You're going to be okay, come on. Griffin, at least I think it's you. The clothes, they're for your own benefit. It's rather off-putting when I'm not visible. Would you like a cup of tea? I'm not here for refreshments. Ah. Verification, that's what you want, correct? Well I would be lying if I said otherwise. Unbelievable, holy shit. - It's astonishing. - Mind the hands. Is this sufficient? Yes. I was told what to expect, but this is unbelievable. You're shaking, you nervous? No. Faith brought you my work? She did. Though I don't know what she sees in you. Pity, I imagine. I was hoping we could discuss anything but her. Well I would feel the same way if I was sleeping with your fiance. She was never your fiance. Relax. She told me about your condition. Did you review my work? I did, however your work does not define your intentions. What do you mean? It doesn't answer why. I want to know why you've pursued this. Does that matter? It does to me. I don't have an answer for you. Well, I'm astonished at what you've been able to accomplish, but I cannot support the publication of your work. I don't understand. Let me explain. Your work is not complete. The formula is scattershot, at best. You proceeded with human testing without permission, which is against the law. Your although successful replication has been inconsistent. Now this is further complicated by the rapid deterioration of your health. This would be deadly to anyone who attempts to undertake it. You're jealous. I did something people have only dreamed of and you can't stand it. - What would you expect? - You need to leave. I said leave. - Tristan, Tristan. - He's crazy. - Wait, what happened? - and dangerous. - He threw me out. - What? He literally threw me out. You don't put your hands on another employee. Okay wait, wait, Tristan. What are we gonna do about this? I allowed this study to take place. We're all in this together. You need to get this under control. Let me talk to him. What is there to talk? Well what set him off? The fact that I rejected his study. I take that back, he's sick, that's what it is. You want to hear the truth? He is, but you are not helping. I don't want to help, I want him gone. Do you have any idea what he's going through? I don't care. Do you? Are you defending him? Okay, well if you don't want to help, that's fine. But the last thing that I need is for you to add to the problem. So what do you want me to do? Let me handle it. He needs to be under a doctor's supervision. I know. What if he hurts you? Well then it's something the two of you will have in common. I don't even know who you are anymore. You know what Tristan? Life isn't simple. You don't get to just walk away when things get hard. I need to help him. You know how hard it is to not just walk in there and rip off his head? Yes. This is wrong. You have 24 hours. I really messed things up, didn't I? Yes. What did I do? You don't remember? No. I think I was angry. Okay, we don't have much time, we have to get you to a doctor. No, I remember now, bits of what he said. He asked me why I chose of all things invisibility to study. It was because of my son. I saw him in my own face. I needed to find a way to not have to see him when I looked at myself, I couldn't bear it. And that's why I took the monocaine. It wasn't a choice, I'm sorry. But you must know that I love you. Of course. Do you know what I would do, if this hasn't happened? What's that? I'd stop working. I'm not really an outdoors type, but I can see myself in a house in the woods. I would sit, stare at the trees and never work again. It would be a paradise. Now would I be there? Yes. You would be my wife. How? You'd have to ask first. - Of course. - I'm old-fashioned that way. Faith Anne Shipley, will you marry me? I'd like that. If I could give you my heart and my blood to heal you. What did you say? - What? - Blood. Blood. What if I had a transfusion of plasma? Infuse the antibodies in my system, replace the deficiency I have inside me. Then, then, Then we could stop the process of deterioration that's happening to you. And? And it would flush our your system and would make you... Visible. Come on, come on, let's go. What happened? Did you do this? Me? Why would I? Why would you do this? You kissed him. What are you talking about? I saw you. I didn't kiss anyone. Are you in love with him? Tristan? No, no, no. You have to listen to me. Griffin, stop, you don't understand. You're sick, Griffin. Griffin stop. You might not want to try to stand. How does your head feel? It hurts. I imagine it does. You hit me. It's not right, Faith. What? Tristan, me. I don't know what you're playing at, but it needs to stop. What I don't understand is why you don't choose. You're not thinking straight. Oh but I am. You know, studying privates, there is often conflict that exists between alpha males, that's what's happening here. The female, the female isn't forced to choose, no. No, it's males, they make the decision. They resolve the conflict amongst themselves to make the choice easier. What did you do? Griffin, what did you do? Decided to make the choice easier for you. Confront him face to face so to speak. Remove him from our life. What did you do? I used your phone, texted him. I told him that you'd worked everything out, got me under control, and that you wanted him to come here. That you needed his help. I told him you loved him. Why? Why would you do that? - You do, right? - No! - You still love him. - No. He's on his way now. Okay, what does that mean? Are you going to hurt him? Don't say that with disdain. You were the cause of all this. If you'd just chosen either of us definitively, none of this would be happening. Griffin? Griffin? Hey Griffin, look at me. What happened to you? Were you hurt? Who did this to you? You don't remember? Okay, hey I need your help, okay? I need you to take me to the hospital. Okay. It's going to be okay. Who did this? Did Tristan do this to you? Tristan, you need to go, now. What's going on? Answers, that's what we're here for. Are you hurt? This is your fault. Getting involved where you don't belong. What are you talking about? I saw you, I saw you. You, you, you know what you did. You knew we were together, but that didn't stop you. This is what you wanted from the beginning, to reject my work, to take Faith away from me. Well it won't happen. You wanted to see what invisibility looked like, well then look. Leave him alone! You gonna defend him now? I asked you a question, answer me. Screw you. Why would you do this to me? You need to stop, okay? You're not thinking straight. Things have never been clearer to me in my life. Stay out of this. You see what you did getting involved where you don't belong? I'm gonna ask you again. Why? Answer me! You see what you made me do? I'm gonna kill you. The choice of who lives or dies is not up to us. I believe that it is only fair time for Faith to choose. It was the indecision on her part that created the situation. So, my love, what will it be? You need to make a choice. You want me to choose between you? Go ahead, he's gonna kill me anyway. Is it true, or will you let him go? If you choose me. Then you'll let him go? With the caveat that your words are true. - You. - What? I choose you. She's lying to you. What do you expect her to say? Don't, don't listen to him. How could she love you? You're a freak! I love you, I love you, just you, okay? Prove it. He has been the cause of every bad thing that has happened between us. He has taken all that's perfect and cast it in doubt. Take it, take it. You need to end this now. I can't, I can't. Once he's dead, we can put all this behind us and move on. This is the only way. Griffin! You can't be serious. Faith run. Griffin, no no no. Griffin, stop. Stop. Faith? Faith? Tristan, Tristan, hey wake up. Are you okay? What? Shh. Stop, Griffin, stop, stop. Please, why are you doing this? Griffin? Hey. Griffin, hey. You lied to me. I was already pretty drunk. You made that choice. No, no. No Griffin, no! No, what. Griffin! Why are you doing this to yourself? No. Griffin, please. Griffin. It's okay, you're gonna be okay. You're going to be okay. Come here, hold on, you're gonna be fine, okay? Let's get this off. Alright. Hey. Can you see me? Yeah. To make me visible, the answer we've been looking for, is death. No. What about you? Hey, don't worry about me right now. I always worry about you. I love you. I have to find you help, hold on. Don't leave me. Okay I won't, I won't. Hey. Hey. My son. I see you. Okay, I see you. Okay, I see you. I see you. Griffin? Griffin, Griffin? Griffin.
